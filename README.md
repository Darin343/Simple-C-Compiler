Compiler for Simple C, an abridged version of the C programming language. Simple C programs are valid C programs, but not all C features are supported (like function pointers, floating point arithmetic etc... )

Targets 64 bit ARM assembly, written in C++. 

Employs recursive descent parsing techniques, constructs a symbol table from disambiguated syntactical grammars, implements static type checks and error reporting. 

Work in progress!
